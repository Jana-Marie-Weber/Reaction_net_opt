# Models for reaction network optimisation

## Model formulation 

The two approaches to solve such problems are the [RNFA], where stationary material balances model a steady-state of the system and constrain the network, and [petri nets] or [PNO], where tokens move through the network simulating the molecular flow. Please consult the [models] folder for the implemented equations and the [case_study] folder for data input. 


## How to run abstract models in pyomo..

Please ensure you fulfil the system requirements. Then, run following command in the command line in your terminal.

```
pyomo solve MODEL_XXX.py INPUT_FILE_XXX.dat --solver=cplex 
```
Your result will be saved in ```results.yml file```.
